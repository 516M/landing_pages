# Landing Pages - Odin Project

These sites were written by hand following the Odin Project. 

1. Innovator: This was the first site created which took approximately ~2 weeks.
2. Space: This was made in several days.
3. Default: This is was primarily created by eyeballing the example site image. It was done to ensure I could quickly put everything together, so like as proof that I understood what I've learnt.

- For Github pages, Space is the default site that will appear.

### Hints

- The 3 links at the top right each lead to a different page.
